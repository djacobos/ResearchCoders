Given we have a product to search 
When we go to the store
Then return an aisle number


Problem were solving: Someone comes to you and says, would'nt it be nice if when I go to Walmart my app would tell me what aisle a product is in?
What were building: An app.
Platform: For now Android is fine.
How would we go about to do this taking the TDD (Test Driven Development) approach
